# pi-environment-sensor

This is a WIP using a [raspberry pi zerow](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) and an [adafruit bme688 sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5046) to build a small wireless environment sensor.

# Overview

This is what my development environment looks like at the moment, uses a bit of some double sided tape to secure the parts to the lid of a plastic container. This keeps them all together and avoids wires and such hanging around.

# Prequisites

Before you can build this you need to download the "BSEC 2.x Software" from https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/software/bme688-software/#aistudio and extract it into the project folder.
